I’m Gururaj. My journey in programming started in 2nd PU when I took PCMCs. I was so fascinated by coding that I scored 99 in Computer Science — and that one lost mark is still a reminder of how much I enjoy getting things exactly right.

Even though I later completed my engineering in Electronics and Communication, my real passion always leaned towards software. So I built my career around it. I started at Tata Electronics as a developer and later joined Swaragh Technologies as a web developer, where I worked on impactful projects like a multi-tenant SaaS platform, a project management system, and an appointment management system.

Technically, I work confidently with Python and JavaScript and have hands-on experience across Node.js, Express.js, Django, Laravel, and React.js. I also work with cloud and DevOps tools like Docker, Nginx, Kubernetes, and Linux.

What truly differentiates me from others is that I’m extremely quick at understanding systems end-to-end.
I don’t limit myself to just frontend or backend — I dive into the architecture, figure out how things work, and deliver complete solutions. I’m self-driven, I learn fast, and I adapt to any technology without hesitation.
If something is new, I don’t wait for guidance — I explore, experiment, and master it.

Outside work, I enjoy travelling, exploring food, fitness, and spending quality time with friends and family. These help me stay curious, disciplined, and balanced — qualities I bring to my work as well.
