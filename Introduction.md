I’m Gururaj. My journey in programming started in 2nd PU when I took PCMCs. I was so fascinated by coding that I scored 99 in Computer Science.

Although I graduated in Electronics and Communication, my real passion was always software. So I built my career around it. I started my development journey at Tata Electronics and later joined Swaragh Technologies as a web developer. During this time, I worked on impactful projects like a multi-tenant SaaS platform, a project management system, and an appointment management system.

Technically, I’m strong in Python and JavaScript and have hands-on experience across Node.js, Django, Laravel, and React.js. Additionally i am femiliar with Docker, Nginx, Kubernetes, and Linux.

What really differentiates me is that I understand systems end-to-end. I don’t limit myself to just frontend or backend — I dive into the architecture, figure out how every part works, and deliver complete, reliable solutions. I’m passionate about learning, dedicated to my work, and I consistently go beyond expectations. I’m dependable, well-organized, and I enjoy collaborating with teams to solve real problems. Whenever something is new, I don’t wait for instructions — I explore, experiment, and pick it up quickly.

Outside of work, I enjoy travelling, exploring food, fitness, and spending time with friends and family. These help me stay curious, disciplined, and balanced — qualities I bring into my professional life as well.
