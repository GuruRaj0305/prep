I’m Gururaj, a software developer with around two years of hands-on experience building and maintaining production-level web applications. I primarily work with JavaScript and Python, focusing on backend systems, APIs, and scalable application design.

I started my career at Tata Electronics and currently work at Swaragh Technologies, where I’ve been involved in building real-world systems such as a multi-tenant SaaS platform, a project management system, and an appointment management application. These projects gave me strong exposure to designing features end-to-end — from database and backend logic to frontend integration.

Although my degree is in Electronics and Communication, my strength has always been programming. I had an early start during my PCMCs, where I scored 99 in Computer Science, and that problem-solving mindset has carried into my professional work.

Technically, I’m strong in Python and JavaScript, with experience using Node.js, Django, Laravel, and React. I also have working knowledge of Docker, Nginx, Kubernetes, and Linux, which helps me understand how applications behave beyond just writing code.

What differentiates me is that I don’t work in silos. I focus on understanding the full system — how components interact, where failures can happen, and how to build solutions that are reliable and maintainable. I’m quick to pick up new technologies and take ownership of what I work on.
